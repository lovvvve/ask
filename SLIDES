# Frustrating Command Line Kofu Searching Experience
- Step 1: need some commands
- Step 2: google / duckduckgo / wiki to find the some probably broken command
- Step 3: copy and paste the command line
- Step 4: tweak the command until it work, otherwise go back to step 2
- Forget it.

# What We Want To Archieve
- Query for knowledge right from your terminal
- Accumulate your knowledge along the time
- Leverage the knowledge in the community, such as commandlinefu.com

    bin/ask query wget (--remote)
    bin/ask query ssh sort uniq
